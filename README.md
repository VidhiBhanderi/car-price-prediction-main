# Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the prices of cars using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various factors such as the car's make, model, year of production, mileage, and other relevant features, we aim to build an accurate predictive model.

The dataset used in this project contains historical car data with corresponding prices. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering techniques, we extract meaningful insights from the dataset. We then train and evaluate different machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for predicting car prices.

The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for estimating the prices of cars, which can be useful for both car buyers and sellers. The implementation and results of the predictive model are documented in this repository, along with detailed explanations of the methodology and code.

By leveraging the power of machine learning, this project aims to assist individuals in making informed decisions when it comes to buying or selling cars, ultimately enhancing their overall car purchasing experience.
